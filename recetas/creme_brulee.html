        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1200g/mL or 5c heavy cream </li>
            <li>1 fresh madagascar vanilla bean (sub 8g/2tsp vanilla extract)</li>
            <li>160g or 3/4c+2Tbsp granulated sugar </li>
            <li>2g or 1/2tsp salt </li>
            <li>10 large eggs, whites and yolks separated </li>
            <li>30-40g of sugar in the raw </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice vanilla bean down 1 side then use a knife to scrape as much of the bean paste from inside the bean as possible. </li>
            <li>Add heavy cream to a small sauce pot along with vanilla bean paste and the scraped vanilla bean. Stir and heat over medium until temperature reaches 150F/65C then remove from heat and allow liquid and vanilla to steep for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk together salt, sugar, and egg yolks. Add in about half of the seeped vanilla cream through a fine mesh strainer, whisking immediately to temper. Stir in second half of cream. Strain combined cream/egg sugar mixture through a fine mesh strainer, making sure to get all of the vanilla paste bits that may be stuck to the bowl. </li>
            <li>Pour custard mix into ramekins</li>
            <li>Using a butane torch, lightly and quickly heat the top of the custard to pop any bubbles that formed from pouring the cream. </li>
            <li>Wrap the top of each ramekin tightly with plastic wrap then pierce the top a couple of times with a sharp knife or cake tester. I place all ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet to make for easier loading into the oven.</li>
            <li>Load into a preheated 215F/100-105C oven to bake for 2 hours or until just set. They should be just a little jiggly, but not liquidy. Internal temp should read around 170F/77C+.</li>
            <li>Let it cool down for about 15min before efrigerating to fully cool for at least 2 hours</li>
        </ol>
